# Quranic Quotes Generator

## Overview

This program is a simple Python application that generates random Quranic quotes. It demonstrates several fundamental programming skills including class definition, object instantiation, list manipulation, and random selection.

## Skills Demonstrated

1. **Class Definition**: The `Quote` class is defined to encapsulate the quote and its reference.
2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Objects of the `Quote` class are instantiated to store individual quotes.
3. **String Representation**: The `__str__` method is overridden to provide a readable string representation of the `Quote` objects.
4. **List Manipulation**: The quotes are stored in a list, showcasing how to manage collections of objects.
5. **Random Selection**: The `random.choice` function is used to randomly select a quote from the list.
6. **Function Definition**: The `generate_quote` function is defined to encapsulate the logic for selecting a random quote.

## How to Run the Program

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Copy the code below into a Python file, for example `quranic_quotes.py`.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the `quranic_quotes.py` file.
5. Run the program by typing `python quranic_quotes.py`.
